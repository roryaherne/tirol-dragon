Kettlebells are cast-iron weights (resembling a cannonball with a handle) used to perform ballistic exercises that combine cardiovascular, strength and flexibility training. Unlike traditional dumbbells, the Kettlebell's centre of mass is extended beyond the hand, which facilitates ballistic and swinging movements.
