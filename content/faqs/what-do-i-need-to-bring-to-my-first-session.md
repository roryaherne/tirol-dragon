title: What do I need to bring to my first session?
answer: If you are coming to try a BJJ class and donâ€™t have a Gi, wear tracksuit
  pants or shorts and a t-shirt. Make sure you bring a LARGE bottle of water and
  a towel. Be sure to arrive 10 minutes early so we can meet you and show you
  through our gym.
