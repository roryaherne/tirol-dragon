    question: What do I need to bring to my first session?
    answer: If you are coming to try a BJJ class and don’t have a Gi, wear tracksuit pants or shorts and a t-shirt. Make sure you bring a LARGE bottle of water and a towel. Be sure to arrive 10 minutes early so we can meet you and show you through our gym.

    question: What can I expect from my first lesson?
    answer: Like any new thing, your first lesson can be a bit daunting! Don’t worry, we will make sure that you receive plenty of guidance so that you feel comfortable and are able to complete the routines and techniques. Usually, this means we will partner you up with someone with a bit more experience who will help you and “show you the ropes”.
