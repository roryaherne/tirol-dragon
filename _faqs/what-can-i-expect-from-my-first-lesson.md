title: What can I expect from my first lesson?
answer: Like any new thing, your first lesson can be a bit daunting! Don’t
  worry, we will make sure that you receive plenty of guidance so that you feel
  comfortable and are able to complete the routines and techniques. Usually,
  this means we will partner you up with someone with a bit more experience who
  will help you and “show you the ropes”.
